    <h1>Kneel Before Zod!</h1>
	
	This <a href="home.html">site</a> is the HTML5/CSS3 homework for the DePaul University Web Development with JavaScript and HTML5 class, Fall Quarter 2013.<br/><br/>
	
	For the <a href="home.html">Home</a> Page I used the BootStrap Offcanvas template.
	<ol>
		<li>The Responsive Design was inherited from the BootStrap template, including the mobile top navigation and the toggle right navigation.</li>
		<li>I updated some of the &lt;div&gt; tags to use the semantic &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;article&gt; tags (this did not break Responsive Design functionality).&nbsp;&nbsp;The &lt;footer&gt; semantic tag was already in use by the BootStrap template.</li>
		<li>The &lt;audio&gt; tag was added.</li>
		<li>A custom font was added from Google.</li>
		<li>A gradient background was used for the "jumbotron" top section.</li>
		<li>This page was successfully checked as HTML5 by W3C.</li>
	</ol>
	<br/>
	For the <a href="contact3.html">Contact Zod</a> Page I used the BootStrap Starter template.
	<ol>
		<li>The Responsive Design was inherited from the BootStrap template, and similar to the home page, updated template to use some semantic tags.</li>
		<li>I used the HTML5 &lt;email&gt; form tag, but it was not recognized on FireFox v25 (Windows XP), but it did work on Chrome (Windows XP).  Per this Mozilla <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list">link</a> it does not seem to be supported at this point.</li>
		<li>This was successfully checked as HTML5 by W3C.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<br/><br/>
	<i>Support of browsers like IE8 or earlier was purposely removed from this BootStrap template.</i>
	</p>
